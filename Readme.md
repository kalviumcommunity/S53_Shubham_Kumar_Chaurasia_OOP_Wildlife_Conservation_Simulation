# Wildlife Conservation Simulation

## Overview

The Wildlife Conservation Simulation is an interactive educational project that simulates the management of endangered species and their habitats. This simulation aims to educate users about the importance of wildlife conservation, the challenges faced in protecting endangered species, and the impact of human actions on various ecosystems.

## Purpose

This project serves multiple purposes:

1. Educational tool for schools and universities
2. Awareness program for conservation organizations
3. Training simulation for aspiring conservationists
4. Interactive platform to engage the public in wildlife protection issues 

## Main Features

- Manage and monitor endangered species
- Simulate various habitats and ecosystems
- Allocate resources for conservation efforts
- Implement different conservation strategies
- Observe the long-term impact of decisions on species populations

## Project Structure

The simulation is built using object-oriented programming principles and includes the following main classes:

- `Species`: Represents individual endangered animals
- `Habitat`: Represents the environments where species live
- `Conservationist`: Manages interactions and implements conservation strategies

The project also utilizes:

- Encapsulation: To protect sensitive data about species and habitats
- Inheritance: To create specific species types (e.g., Bird, Mammal, Reptile)
- Polymorphism: To allow different species to respond uniquely to conservation efforts
- Abstraction: To simplify user interactions with the simulation
